## Overview
- This is a NFT preview card component which is responsive.

### The challenge

Since I have just started learning Tailwind CSS, installation part was a bit tough for me as it had three methods of installation.
- Using CDN
- Tailwind CLI
- PostCSS

I decided to go with CDN as it is less time consuming and I could quickly set up the project. 

However I found it less efficient as Tailwind Intellisense (VS Code extension which suggests different classes base on what we type) does not work. 
### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Built with

I have started learning [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and the best way to learn anything is to build projects as much as we can. Tailwind has a lot of customization options. It is a utility based CSS framework.

- Built with Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- I learned how to install Tailwind in our project.
- It is better to install via Tailwind CLI, not via CDN - my understanding.
- Knew how to customize the tailwind config file and knew a lot of classes.
- Responsiveness in Tailwind
